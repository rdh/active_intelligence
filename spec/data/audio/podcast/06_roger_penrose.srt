00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,290
Hello and welcome to this series on physics and philosophy from the University of Oxford Artificial Intelligence.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,010
The term conjures up apocalyptic visions of armies of robots taking over the world and enslaving the human race.

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,360
Technology today is indeed progressing at an ever growing rate.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,240
A pocket calculator can solve problems in a matter of seconds that a human would take much longer today.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,190
Many of our mundane and repetitive jobs are now being taken care of by machines.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,790
But could a computer ever truly replace a human? Could it enjoy the Northern Lights or fall in love and write a poem?

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,570
I'm on guitar and Evan and I'm speaking to Sir Roger Penrose, emeritus professor of mathematics and fellow of Wadham College, Oxford.

8
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:53,070
Although a mathematician at heart, he has made extensive contributions in the fields of physics, philosophy and even art.

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,240
He is the recipient of many awards and prizes, including the 1988 Woolf prize for his work in Black Holes.

10
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,040
His book, The Emperor's New Mind and its sequel, Shadows of the Mind,

11
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:11,760
explored the idea of artificial intelligence and whether the human mind could ever be fully replicated by a computer.

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,500
So do you think that the human mind can ever be replicated by a computer?

13
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,090
I don't, actually. But we have to be careful about the terminology.

14
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,160
I mean, I think that the conscious aspects of the human mind I mean, mind you may include unconscious activities also,

15
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,650
but what's involved in consciousness is not to do with computation,

16
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,440
and that no matter how complicated the computation is, it would not evoke consciousness,

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,630
nor would it be able to do the things that I believe consciousness actually is used for.

18
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,440
So I think of consciousness is something which actually does affect our behaviour.

19
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,670
Some people refer to an epi phenomenon, which means that it just happens to tag along.

20
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:03,520
If you have a computational action, for example, or some kind of action and consciousness sort of comes along as a passenger, I don't take that view.

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,530
It's a more active role that it plays. I'm not quite sure I could define that in any way that would make a philosopher happy.

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,320
But nevertheless, I do think it's an active role and it's serving a purpose.

23
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:28,290
So that's the evolution of consciousness in in us and in other animals is in my, in my view, something which had a strong selective advantage.

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,650
So that's why we have it, if you like. But that is not something that a computer does.

25
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:42,180
And the reasons I have believing this mainly come from mathematical logic.

26
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,460
So although there's arguments which I've been trying to make for a long time,

27
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:55,710
first in the Emperor's New Mind and more in more detail in my later book, Shadows of the Mind.

28
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,360
But in many other writings, I have tried to make the case that I think it's actually a strong case,

29
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:13,050
that there is something quite different that we use our consciousness for, which is not something that could be actually done by a computer as such.

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:23,900
To clarify that a little bit. I don't necessarily mean that some device made by some mad scientist or a same scientist,

31
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:33,200
some latter day Frankenstein say who could construct some entity out of maybe inanimate materials,

32
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,670
which might conceivably be conscious, but it would not be a computer in the sense that we use that word today.

33
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,710
So what exactly would the difference be? What is it about a computer that it cannot have consciousness?

34
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:54,450
Well, this is the centenary year of Alan Turing, so it's nice to be able to relate this discussion to Turing's work.

35
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,559
You see,

36
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:08,160
Turing in the 1930s put forward a very interesting concept which was basically making clear what a lot of other logicians were doing at the time,

37
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:16,920
which was what is a computation. There were some mathematical problems or classes of problems which had been proposed as you can.

38
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,740
You find an automatic way of solving all these problems.

39
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:27,960
And in order to address that question, Turing had to make clear what it meant to say an automatic process.

40
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:37,230
And he also showed that there are mathematical problems which lie outside the scope of any automatic process.

41
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:45,870
This was part of his initial thesis. This was more or less known already to gerdau and famous logician.

42
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,580
But I think, as Goodall himself appreciated,

43
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:58,260
Turing's way of looking at it made it much clearer that his way was actually encompassing what you really mean by computation.

44
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,340
Now, the idea is that a computation is something which needs no means to do it.

45
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,570
It just goes on automatically. It has rules which it follows.

46
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:16,080
And these rules are made very clear. And we they are the basis of what we now understand by a general purpose computer.

47
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,300
So a Turing machine, the notion that Turing introduced in whenever it was 1935 or something, the idea.

48
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:34,370
Is basically what we now understand by a general purpose computer or an ordinary or a laptop idealised in basically three ways.

49
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,309
One is it has unlimited storage space, so it can keep on you can keep on adding memory, if you like,

50
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:48,470
and unlimited storage space that it can go on indefinitely without ever wearing out and that it never makes mistakes.

51
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,990
So it's idealised in those ways.

52
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,920
But when you've idealised it in those ways, you could actually see the limitations as Turing himself was very clear about.

53
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,420
So initially, he he, I believe, tried to explore how you might go beyond his ideas.

54
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:16,190
I think that perhaps his his experiences at Bletchley Park with decoding and realising the power of electronic computers.

55
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:25,430
He shifted his view and went around to the view that maybe we are just computers in some very sophisticated code.

56
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:34,370
But I would dispute that. Let me paraphrase Girls Famous Incompleteness Theorem in a slightly different way.

57
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:42,690
This is more the Turing way. Suppose you're trying to prove certain statements in mathematics.

58
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,430
Now, these are statements which have to do with in the infinite in some way.

59
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,150
They always have to do with the infinite. You might say, how can we know about the infinite?

60
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,320
Well, let me give you a statement, which I think you would agree is pretty obviously true, even though it talks about the infinite.

61
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,180
If you add two even numbers together, you always get another even number.

62
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,860
You never get an odd number. There is no odd number, which is the sum of two even numbers.

63
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,960
Now that's a statement about all numbers, no matter how absolutely, fantastically enormous they might be.

64
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,980
And yet we can perceive for various reasons why that's true.

65
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,700
If you add even numbers together, you get another even number. Okay.

66
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,770
There are much more sophisticated statements like that.

67
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,990
Like the famous Fermat's Last Theorem, which is another example of something of a similar character.

68
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,950
Now let's just take simple statements.

69
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,000
When I say this simple, that may be very difficult to prove that statements like that,

70
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,590
which are to do with natural numbers, the numbers zero one, two, three, four, etc.

71
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,940
So we know what we're talking about. They're not some highfalutin concept.

72
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,810
But the statements about these numbers, such as the still unproved goldbach conjecture,

73
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,260
every even number greater than two is the sum of two prime numbers.

74
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,270
So if you know the prime numbers, it's a fairly clear statement. Nobody knows whether that's true or not.

75
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,680
It's just people suspect it is true. But there is no known proof.

76
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,510
Okay. Now, how would you expect to be able to prove statements like this?

77
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:22,560
Well, you might have some kind of system rules, axioms, rules of procedure, which if you follow them properly, you come up with yes or no.

78
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:31,720
Now the key point about these rules is that they are computationally checkable so that if I produce.

79
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,340
An alleged proof. I can put this on the machine and it says, Yup, you've done the rules right?

80
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,590
Or You made a mistake there. So that's what I mean by computationally checkable.

81
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,519
Okay. So you can put that on the computer. I don't say that it knows what it's doing.

82
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,750
It just can check whether or not the rules have been correctly followed.

83
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,850
Now, here is the girl Turing statement. This is Turing's version of girl statement.

84
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,290
Whatever those rules are, let's call them a capital R.

85
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:11,719
So when these rules rules are the rules. If I know what they are, I can construct a statement of the kind that I'm talking about.

86
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,800
Right. Some of the prime numbers and so on. I can construct a statement which has the following two properties.

87
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:29,150
First of all, it's true, provided the rules do not enable me to prove that two equals three.

88
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:40,280
If I trust the rules to the extent that I know they will never enable me to prove two equals three, then this other statement is certainly true.

89
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,780
Yet that other statement cannot be proved using the rules.

90
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,910
So our understanding inside can.

91
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,070
Supersede or transcend any system of rules whatsoever.

92
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,720
If you give me a system of rules which are meant to be the way mathematicians prove these statements,

93
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:10,940
I can go away and construct in a very clear cut way a statement which I can show is beyond the scope of the rules.

94
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:18,960
Yet it's still true. And the key point is knowing that it's true comes from my trust in the rules.

95
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,730
So it's my very trust in the rules which enables me to transcend the rules.

96
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,010
Now, that's very remarkable statement. It shows that we don't work by rules.

97
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,120
Okay. There are various objections you might make to say, well, we don't know what we are, we don't know what calculations we do and so on.

98
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,620
I don't believe any of those objections really get to the point.

99
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:46,500
Turing's answer. He knew perfectly well that statement. Turing's answer was, Well, human beings make mistakes.

100
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:54,240
And that's where our superiority lies. Okay, maybe that I really don't think that is what makes us superior to computers.

101
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,660
You can make computers, make mistakes. It's easy to see. So I don't believe that that's.

102
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,840
Why? We can do certain things that computers can't, and we do them because we understand what we're doing.

103
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,770
Now, I don't know what understanding really is, but whatever it is, it's something which computers don't have.

104
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,959
When we use computers and we do it also, we can make them play chess.

105
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,950
We can make them do calculations to do wonderful simulations in science and so on.

106
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,910
But the computer doesn't know what it's doing. It doesn't know it churns out an answer.

107
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:38,030
It may say yes or no. It may say it takes note, but it hasn't the faintest idea what it's doing.

108
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,790
It doesn't understand what it's doing.

109
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:49,490
It's the understanding that enables us to transcend the rules if we understand the rules enough to believe them.

110
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,080
That same trust in the rules enables us to transcend the rules.

111
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,639
Now, that's very clear. But God approved.

112
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,630
And Turing's version, he said, is in terms of computation, it's the same girls there.

113
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,340
I could even prove it to you. It's not that hard to prove this statement.

114
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,780
It's a little bit contorted how you do it. It's not that hard to prove.

115
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,989
Now, when I learned about this, not quite in the form.

116
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,530
I've said it here when I was a graduate student at Cambridge.

117
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,900
Before that, I probably would have believed that we were all computers in some form.

118
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,810
You see, I was, you know, I was that much of a materialist, if you like to use that word.

119
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,879
But after hearing about the Gardner Theorem, after hearing this from a logician,

120
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,910
a lecturer we had in Cambridge, it seemed clear to me, okay, there's something else going on in our heads.

121
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,040
And I do believe that something in our heads, it's not something which comes mystically from outside.

122
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:52,450
I mean, some people might think that no, I believe it's something to do with the goings on inside our heads, which is not computational.

123
00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:03,660
Now. I had believed this for many decades, but when it came to, I had the idea that someday I would write a book for the general public.

124
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,429
You see, I just had this ambition. Maybe long after I'm retired.

125
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:19,790
I will have time to do this, you see. But I heard a radio talk where Marvin Minsky, who is a very strong person, he believes we're all computers and.

126
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,210
And Edward Fradkin was another of the same beliefs.

127
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,720
And they were arguing things which seem to me to be quite extreme.

128
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,020
Like if you walk from one end of the room, the other end of the room,

129
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,330
there are two computers communicating with each other in the time you walk from one end of the room to the other.

130
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,420
They have communicated more things to each other than the human race has ever done in its whole existence.

131
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:49,430
You see. So I said, Well, I see where you're coming from. If you take the view that what we do is computations.

132
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,770
Yeah, I suppose I could see your logic. I don't believe it, because I don't think that's what we do.

133
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,970
I think understanding is something which is not a computational process.

134
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,830
And that's what makes us different from computers. Yes. Well, there are lots of things that make us different.

135
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,750
I think, you know, feelings, emotions and artist appreciation.

136
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,800
But I'm only concentrating on this one quality, which is understanding.

137
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,130
And there I think you can make a good case that what we do is not computational.

138
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,510
So do you think that science can fully understand the mind?

139
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,460
I think it's possible. Now, you see, here's where it's much more speculative.

140
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,670
I think the girl statement, despite the fact that many people argue with me and you be surprised how many rude things they say.

141
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,560
But it seems to me the argument when presented clearly is absolutely clear.

142
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,940
Okay. They say, well, we don't know what algorithm we follow in our heads.

143
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,330
And all this is some very complicated algorithm which gets to mathematics.

144
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,219
I find that completely incredible because you have to say, how did we come about?

145
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,720
Well, natural selection. Natural selection didn't favour people who are doing sophisticated mathematics.

146
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,190
It's quite other things. It favoured understanding. It favoured consciousness.

147
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,630
Consciousness, in my view, is a crucial ingredient to understanding.

148
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,790
But if you ask me, do I think science will ever come to grips with that question,

149
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,920
I think quite possibly whether we would properly completely come to grips with it, I don't know.

150
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,010
But I think we shall make progress on that. But I think that the progress will come.

151
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:31,770
From trying to understand what in physics there could be which lies outside computation.

152
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,899
Now, this is where I get you know, people have trouble agreeing with me.

153
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,190
Sometimes they say, well, we know all about physics, enough about the hand of the brain,

154
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:47,010
where we know all the equations and Newton and Einstein and Schrodinger and so on, and these equations.

155
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,719
Okay, we don't know the full details, but there are things we could put on a computer,

156
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,740
we could make a computer and maybe a bigger one than we have now and fit all the equations in and make it so we just compute it.

157
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,010
Help me. So I say, Well, it's true.

158
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:08,470
Although there are little problems here, there are little problems which I'm going to say are not probably the important one.

159
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,970
One of them is. The very notion of computation depends on the sweetness.

160
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,290
You have bits which can be this way or that way, whereas almost all the equations of physics we know about are continuous.

161
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,810
They depend on continuous parameters. Newton. Still true, Einstein, still true.

162
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,060
Schrödinger, Maxwell. All those equations depend on continuous functions.

163
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,170
I'm saying, okay, that's true. But maybe that's not really the point.

164
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,530
It could be. But I do not believe it.

165
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:46,700
I think that you can simulate with discreet ness close enough to the continuous that probably that's not the answer.

166
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,180
Is there anything else we don't know in physics? Yes.

167
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:57,110
There's this also, when I was a graduate student at Cambridge doing something quite different from my real research at that time,

168
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:06,050
I learned from Dirac about quantum mechanics. The Great Quantum mechanics physicist, and it stayed with me.

169
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,570
There's a big paradox in quantum mechanics. It involves two completely different procedures.

170
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,150
Let's call one the Schrödinger equation, which it is. I use the letter U for that.

171
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,580
That's unitary evolution. That's the word they used. And the other is what you do when you make a measurement.

172
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,980
And then you have to do something quite different,

173
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,810
which is called the collapse of the wave function or the reduction of the state vector for reduction.

174
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:36,980
So you and A of the two processes, if you look at them carefully, they're strictly speaking mutually inconsistent.

175
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,060
If the world works according to you, you can't have any. Ah.

176
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,460
You do how? To me, that says the equations are right.

177
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,600
Okay. They're very, very good, but they're not quite right.

178
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,090
And when they apply to big enough structures, there's something new comes in.

179
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,810
And Schrödinger himself was very clear when he made it. He talked about his cat.

180
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,710
You know, he said, well, I could I won't do it because I'm a nice, humane person.

181
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,720
But I could have an experiment in which a cat is put in a superposition of being alive and dead.

182
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,170
And that's absurd. I mean, he didn't quite put it like that.

183
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:23,140
But basically what he was saying is my equation when I say I'm shooting and you see Schrodinger's equation doesn't explain what happens to cats.

184
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,490
There's something missing. And I agree there is something missing.

185
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,150
And it's that missing thing which has to be involved in our mental processes, in consciousness.

186
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,440
It's not just that quantum mechanics is involved in brain action.

187
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:45,860
It's the missing. Boundary between quantum and classical mechanics, which we don't understand.

188
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:54,820
And when we have that, we might see that it's a non computational process and maybe we can see how it works in the brain.

189
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,290
Maybe we can see what relates to our feelings and other things about consciousness.

190
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,890
So I think it's possible we will make genuine progress. I think we're enormously far from it right now.

191
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,170
In your second book, Shadows of the Mind, you talk about microtubules in the brain.

192
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:18,130
Do you think that any new physics, perhaps not computational new physics, might play a role in microtubules and how these work?

193
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,260
And do you think research in this field may take a little closer to understanding consciousness?

194
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know what this new physics is that will go beyond colour codes, but I do make a guess.

195
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,610
When I wrote The Emperor's New Mind, I couldn't think of any place for this new physics to play a role.

196
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,680
I wrote my book anyway, thinking that by the time I'd written it I would see what the answer was.

197
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:46,940
No, I didn't. However, I was expecting young people maybe to be stimulated by my book.

198
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,270
I'm not sure how many were, but occasionally a scientist would be.

199
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,580
And Stewart Hamer of. I had never heard of him before.

200
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:04,900
Told me he wrote me a letter. They used to write letters in those days in which he pointed out that there was something evidently he didn't know,

201
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:11,150
namely microtubules these as little tubes, which in and also in almost all cells, not quite.

202
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:18,870
They have a special role to play in neurones, he says, and he knows about them because he puts people to sleep.

203
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,140
He's an anaesthesiologist.

204
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:27,130
But unlike many of his colleagues who just put people to sleep and wake them up again, he's interested in what he's actually doing.

205
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,190
What is he doing to the brain when he puts it to sleep?

206
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:38,620
So he wants to know what qualities of the brain, what structures in the brain do the general anaesthetics actually affect?

207
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:46,030
And he comes up with a view that the microtubules neurone or microtubules, which have a different kind of organisation from other cells.

208
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,840
And I was most impressed by this. I'd never heard of them stupidly.

209
00:20:51,620 --> 00:21:02,240
And it seemed to be, well, here's a chance. There are structures with great deal, almost crystalline structure, highly organised tubes.

210
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,190
I thought there's a much better chance than the neurone propagation which gets lost in the environment.

211
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:17,420
That's hopeless. The microtubules, maybe. Now, this has been in a maybe state for a long time, but only within the last couple of years.

212
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:24,260
An Indian scientist who shares your name and your Ben Bandyopadhyay,

213
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:33,080
who has worked in Japan for many years with some Japanese colleagues, has been doing experiments on live microtubules.

214
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,510
These are actually pig brained microtubules. I don't think it's some problem they have getting human ones.

215
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,020
But anyway, pig brain microtubules and.

216
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,250
He has exhibited some very remarkable quantum properties.

217
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,850
So they have very strange properties, high conductivity at very specific frequencies.

218
00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:00,360
You measure the resistance with a certain frequency input and suddenly they become very conductive.

219
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:09,690
And there are different frequencies. There are about eight different channels or frequencies, all working together in some complicated way.

220
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,010
But he argues that this has to be a quantum mechanical process.

221
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,880
You can't understand this from purely classical ideas.

222
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:25,200
This is the beginning of some research, but it's a new area which I think could be extremely exciting.

223
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:35,490
And maybe tell us something very important about what's going on in brain activity, which could be related to what's really going on in consciousness.

224
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,580
And is this non computational that's very hard to tell at this stage.

225
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:52,590
We would only be looking for coherent quantum effects in order for there to be any chance for the new physics that I claim is there to come in.

226
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,550
You need many, many microtubules actually acting in concert.

227
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:03,120
There's not enough displacement of mass. So the criterion that, as I say, this is a done deal.

228
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:11,550
She and I have independently put forward a proposal that if you have enough displacement of mass between two states,

229
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,829
then that gives you a lifetime for how long that superposition can live.

230
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,879
So if you have a superposition, two states, you can work out a lifetime.

231
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:28,170
It can't last for longer than, so it becomes one or the other. Now that lifetime for a single microtubule will be enormously long.

232
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,820
So that can't be in itself. What gives consciousness?

233
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:38,040
Because you aim conscious actions occur in matters of fractions of a second.

234
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,150
So one is looking for many microtubules acting together in some coherent process.

235
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,330
So you would need lots of them acting together. But it's a beginning.

236
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,340
You can't tell from just that experiment that there's anything non computational going on.

237
00:23:53,550 --> 00:24:03,990
It's not even at the level where the new physics would come in is at a level where quantum physics seems to be playing a role at a level where people

238
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:08,129
thought couldn't happen because the temperature is too high and you need low

239
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,390
temperature or isolation or both in order to get coherent quantum effects.

240
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,740
And he seems to be seeing coherent quantum effects at high temperatures.

241
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,740
Body temperature higher than body temperature. And there's a good step.

242
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:28,170
A beginning. It's only a beginning. You need lots of microtubules coherently.

243
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,930
You need to understand about the structure of the brain. You need to understand all sorts of things.

244
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,280
It's a huge story, I'm sure, but at least it's a perhaps a little window into what's going on.

245
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,780
Yes. Thank you very much.
